Some Fiddle Tune is a collection of interviews with — and solo performances by — people who play fiddle tunes. Which may be a confusing description. These are not necessarily people who play fiddle (though many of them do), and these are not people who _only_ play fiddle tunes (though some interviewees may play nothing else). The musicians I'd like to interview may not even be full-time musicians. But they aren't just anybody. They are all cut from the same cloth: the kind of person who feels at home when playing a fiddle tune.

But hold on, we should head back to a more basic question — what on earth is a fiddle tune? Probably there are people who have really specific definitions and a check-list for what must exist in order for a tune to blah blah blah....... A fiddle tune on this website is just an old tune, one whose author is either long dead or just plain unknown, or could be alive, but it doesn't really matter who wrote it. And probably if you're playing a fiddle tune, you're using a fiddle, or a banjo, or a guitar, or a mandolin I suppose, or a bass fiddle, or maybe a Chinese fiddle, or a synthesizer, or even just plain singing — I guess the point is, it could be any instrument.

Whatever the instrument, the picker is probably pretty good at it in general, and now — ready to play the fiddle tune — they've got a little melody in their mind and their fingers, and they're pretty sure they known where they picked up this tune, but maybe they've forgotten, and — you know what — it's no big deal! Nobody really cares if they get it all down note for note — there are a million versions out there, one that comes from Indiana, one from Kentucky or West Virginia (pretty likely), one from a certain county nestled in the Carolina mountains, one from Montreal, one from Dublin, or maybe your grandfather was the only person you ever heard play it quite that way and you've got absolutely no idea where he the hell he picked it up. (You suspect he invented it out of thin air and has always pretended he heard it on an old '78). Or maybe you just heard it on a CD or a TV show — no shame in that, not everybody can be born into tune-loving families from the mountains! (I know I wasn't.) And maybe you don't know the name, but that's cool too — sometimes these tunes don't even have names, and sometimes they have way too many names. And sometimes two tunes even have the same name, yet sound entirely different. Which is the beauty of the whole damn thing.

In general, I'm thinking of old-time music that comes from more southern and eastern states, but also comes from wherever there are fiddlers or banjo players or pickers of any kind. French Canadians seem to love fiddle tunes. And the Irish, though they're called reels or something over there, and Scotland too, and Brittany, and Norway too, though there the fiddles have a whole mess of strings, and Sweden, where the fiddles have keys, and Turkey, Iran, Vietnam, Mongolia (bithplace of bowing?), and China, among others. Wherever people grow up with tunes.

Again, before this introduction gets too long, this is just a collection of interviews with people who play fiddle tunes, like the subheading says. Which I think is a pretty great description, since that could be just about anybody!
